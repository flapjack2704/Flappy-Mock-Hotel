Hello and welcome to my first dabble with EF Core, ASP.Net API and Angular. 

The angular site hits an API, which is connected to an SQL database.
The angular site is built to be used by some hotel employee, while sat at the hotel's front desk.

I plan to host that on Github Pages once the project is "done" (always open to add new features thereafter).
I still need to figure out how to remote host my API and sql database :D

I might add some pretend debit card payment thing later on, but for now just pretend every guest pays with cash (and diligently pays us at the end of their stay, or else.....).
